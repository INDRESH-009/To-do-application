Here's a summary of all the backend development tasks you've accomplished so far:

1. Project Setup

Created a new Node.js project using npm init -y.
Installed necessary packages:
Express: To set up the server and routes.
Mongoose: To interact with MongoDB.
dotenv: To manage environment variables.
Set up a basic Express server running on port 5001.


2. API Development

Defined a RESTful API with four endpoints for CRUD operations:
GET /tasks: Retrieve all tasks.
POST /tasks: Create a new task.
PUT /tasks/:id: Update an existing task by ID.
DELETE /tasks/:id: Delete a task by ID.

Each of these endpoints allows interaction with the backend server to manipulate task data.


3. MongoDB Integration

Connected the backend to MongoDB:
Used MongoDB Atlas (cloud-hosted database).
Created and connected a To-do database.
Defined a Mongoose schema and model for tasks:
Fields: title, completed, and createdAt.
Stored tasks in the tasks collection.


4. Testing the Backend

Used Postman to test all CRUD operations:
Verified that tasks can be created, read, updated, and deleted via the API.
Confirmed data persistence in MongoDB Compass.


5. Key Backend Features Implemented

Dynamic Task Storage:
Replaced the in-memory array with MongoDB for persistent storage.
Error Handling:
Added proper error messages for invalid operations (e.g., missing tasks).
Middleware:
Used express.json() to parse incoming JSON data.
Environment Variables:
Secured the MongoDB connection string using .env.
Your Backend at This Point
Fully functional Express server.
Connected to a MongoDB database.
RESTful API that supports all CRUD operations for tasks.
