- **Wallet Connection**: Users connect their wallets via MetaMask.
- **Event Booking**: Users can book tickets for various events.
- **Profile Page**: Displays purchased tickets along with QR codes.
- **Resale Marketplace**: Allows users to resell tickets within 175%-200% of the original price.
- **Organizer Portal**: Users can create and manage events, with earnings directly sent to their wallets.
- **IPFS Integration**: Ticket metadata stored on **IPFS via Pinata**.
- **QR Code-Based Validation**: Ensures ticket authenticity.
- **Cloudinary Integration**: Stores event images.
